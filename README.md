# sqlite-with-python
In this directory I did some coding in python with sqlite3 library. 


SQLite1.py and SQLite2.py
In these files I did simple operation like creating and connecting an existing database, 
inserted new rows in a table.

SQLite Movies Database.py
In this file I have created new database named "Movies_list.db" and in this database there is one table named "Movies"
